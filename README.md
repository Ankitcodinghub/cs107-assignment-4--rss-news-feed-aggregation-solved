This week’s assignment has you index a few hundred online news articles. Indexing a news article amounts to little more than breaking the content down into the individual words, and noting how many times each word appears. If a particular word appears a good number of times and it isn’t so common that it appear in virtually every other web page, then said word is probably a good indicator as to what the web page is all about. Once everything’s been indexed, you can talk to the database and ask for a list of stories about a specific person, place, or thing. If you’re curious what bipartisan issues are surfacing over the war in Iraq, you can just ask your friendly neighborhood database and it’s sure to come back with a lot:

Please enter a single search term [enter to break]: Iraq

We found 196 articles with the word “Iraq”. [We’ll just list 10, though.]

“news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7046765.stm”

2.) “Blackwater boss grilled over Iraq” [search term occurs 20 times] “news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7024370.stm”

10.) “Interpol IDs a suspected pedophile” [search term occurs 1 time]

“www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2007/10/16/interpol”

If the word is so common that it’s useless, the application will tell you about it:

Please enter a single search term [enter to break]: the

Too common a word to be taken seriously. Try something more specific. Please enter a single search term [enter to break]: whatever

Too common a word to be taken seriously. Try something more specific. Please enter a single search term [enter to break]: without

Too common a word to be taken seriously. Try something more specific. Please enter a single search term [enter to break]: Microsoft

Too common a word to be taken seriously. Try something more specific.

Sometimes a perfectly wonderful thing just doesn’t get mentioned:

Please enter a single search term [enter to break]: CS107 None of today’s news articles contain the word “CS107”.

Starter Code

Once you copy over the Assignment 4 files, you’ll see how much is already done for you. All of the networking needed to find and pull online news articles is there. The starter code compiles, runs, and parses web pages from all over the planet. However, it does not build the indices and allow you to do meaningful queries like those illustrated above. Your job for the next several days is to augment the existing code base and integrate in a hashset or two (or three) to store everything you might need into order to replicate the functionality of my sample application. The focus of the assignment isn’t networking. Assignment 4 is all about taking the client role and using your hashset and vector along with a few other welldocumented data types in order to build a scalable, efficient search engine. We just happen to index news articles instead of the entire web, but in principle what we do here could easily be extended to index every last web page on Earth.

Implementation Strategies

Here’s how I would tackle the assignment if I were you:

• I would load the list of stop words into a hashset of dynamically allocated C strings, and be prepared to pass that hashset through the entire code tree. “stop list” is terminology for a list of words that don’t say much. We never want to insert a word like that into our set of indices, and we want to inform the client when they enter a stop word during the querying phase. Conceptually, this task is pretty easy, but it’ll force you to deal with all of the plumbing required to construct and otherwise manipulate an instance of the generic hashset. Check out the supplied README file for a StringHash function. (There’s a stop word list in the assn-4-rss-newssearch-data directory.)

• Figure out how you’re going to store all of the information needed to imitate the functionality of my sample application. You can’t possibly build a database mapping keywords to relevant documents if you don’t have a clear picture of how everything will be laid out. The hashset and vector are exactly what you want here.

• Introduce another hashset and construct it to just store those words that appear in one or more of the news articles without appearing in the stop list. Pass this hashset down through the code hierarchy. Change BuildIndices to add all of the words, and update QueryIndices to see if the user-supplied search term is in the hashset somewhere. The starter code already divvies up each stream into tokens, filtering out HTML tags and stop words, leaving only the words we care to store.

• Never index the same article twice. Consider two online news articles to be the same if they have the same URL (even if the titles are different), or if they have the same title and come from the same server (i.e., “Clay Aiken Joins Spamalot” might be syndicated twice by www.nytimes.com: once by the Front Page feed, and again by the Entertainment feed).

Implementation Hints

• Copy over the assignment files using cp –r. The assignment directory is assn-4-rss-news-search. There’s a parallel directory (you needn’t copy this one over) called assn-4-rss-news-search-data that contains the RSS feeds and the stop words list you should be using.

• Read all of the interface files—particularly the streamtokenizer.h file, which explains how the streamtokenizer type can used to break down the text of a web page into a series of words. The streamtokenizer is already used quite a bit by the starter application, so between interface and client you should be able to figure out how it works.

• You don’t need to bring over your own vector.c and hashset.c files. I’ve compiled and archived my own implementations in with the implementations of the url, the urlconnection, and the streamtokenizer functions.

• We want the interactive phase of our application to be case-insensitive. That’s easy to support, but it requires we use tolower (in StringHash) and strcasecmp (in a lot of places.) Type man tolower and man strcasecmp at the command prompt for the lowdown on each.

• Choose the number of buckets to be some large prime number. I used 1009 and 10007 in my own solution.

• Be careful to close all files, close all network connections, and free all dynamically allocated memory. All strings that persist beyond the lifetime of a function should be dynamically allocated character arrays of just the right length. Otherwise, you should keep your own dynamic memory allocation to a minimum.

Extension Ideas

• Use a real XML parser! If you’re interested in working with an open source XML parser called expat, then let me know and I’ll hook you up with a version of the starter code that uses it. The current version uses my handwritten XML parser which is much more special-purpose and brittle compared to the real one. I contemplated using the expat version this time around, but decided it would require too much explanation and would blur the focus of the assignment, which is to understand how C strings and our vector and hashset generics work.

• Provide support for multiple word and phrase search. The specification just requires that single search terms be supported, but we all know that search engines are much more robust and intelligent than that. Go ahead and research what types of heuristics simple search engines use to index and query mass quantities of information.

• The web pages we index and dynamically populated with text from advertisements, so you’ll note that irrelevant words like vacuum and gardening appear in web pages about burglaries and nuclear weapon truces. It would be nice if you were to come up with a place that somehow filters out the fluff from the real content so that the index only includes meaningful information.
